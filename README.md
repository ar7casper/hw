##### Instructions:

3. Run ```nodemon``` in the proper directory.
4. Go to http://localhost:3999/html/index.html 

##### Notes: 
1. I've used a queue mechanism to handle the rotation so it would be more smooth and so that events won't get in the way of each other.
2. I haven't done validations on the server side on purpose, same goes for the AJAX calls I'm using.
3. I've added some console.logs in places that I think that are relevant.
4. I tried to write the code as simple and discriptive as possible. Please let me know if there's anything that's not clear.
